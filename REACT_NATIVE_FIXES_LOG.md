# React Native Fixes Log

This document records all issues encountered and fixes applied during the debugging session.

## Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Primary Issues**: Route export errors, displayName errors, expo-av deprecation warnings  
**Duration**: Multiple debugging iterations  

---

## 1. Missing Default Exports Issue

### Problem
Multiple React Native routes were showing errors:
```
WARN Route "./admin/dashboard.tsx" is missing the required default export
WARN Route "./admin/managers/index.tsx" is missing the required default export  
WARN Route "./admin/onboarding/index.tsx" is missing the required default export
WARN Route "./manager/dashboard.tsx" is missing the required default export
WARN Route "./manager/reports/index.tsx" is missing the required default export
WARN Route "./manager/societies/[societyId]/index.tsx" is missing the required default export
WARN Route "./manager/support/index.tsx" is missing the required default export
```

### Root Cause
All these files already had proper default exports, so this was likely a false positive or caching issue.

### Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Verified all routes have proper default exports and displayName assignments

---

## 2. DisplayName Property Errors

### Problem
Recurring error throughout the session:
```
ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'displayName' of undefined
```

### Multiple Attempts and Findings

#### Attempt 1: RoleGuard Component
**File**: `/components/auth/RoleGuard.tsx`  
**Issue**: Line 173 tried to set `PermissionGate.displayName` before component was defined  
**Fix**: Moved displayName assignment after component definition  
**Result**: ❌ Error persisted

#### Attempt 2: Hook Selector Functions
**Files**: Multiple hook files (`useDirectAuth.ts`, `useDirectSociety.ts`, `useDirectAdmin.ts`)  
**Issue**: Anonymous selector functions missing displayName properties  
**Fix**: Added displayName properties to selector functions  
**Result**: ❌ Error persisted

#### Attempt 3: RoleGuard HOC Safety
**File**: `/components/auth/RoleGuard.tsx` line 135  
**Issue**: `RequireRole` HOC accessing `Component.displayName` without null checks  
**Fix**: Added optional chaining: `Component?.displayName || Component?.name || 'Unknown'`  
**Result**: ❌ Error persisted

#### Attempt 4: Auth Selector Function
**File**: `/hooks/useDirectAuth.ts`  
**Issue**: Main `authSelector` function missing displayName property  
**Fix**: Added `authSelector.displayName = 'authSelector';`  
**Result**: ❌ Error persisted

#### Final Fix: ManagerSupport Function Declaration
**File**: `/app/manager/support/index.tsx`  
**Issue**: Function declaration incompatible with displayName assignment  
**Fix**: Changed `function ManagerSupport()` to `const ManagerSupport = ()`  
**Result**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

### Root Cause
The error was occurring because React DevTools was trying to access the `displayName` property on a function declaration. Converting to a function expression (arrow function) resolved the compatibility issue.

## 3. Expo-AV Deprecation Warning

### Problem
```
WARN [expo-av]: Expo AV has been deprecated and will be removed in SDK 54. 
Use the `expo-audio` and `expo-video` packages to replace the required functionality.
```

### Files Affected
- `/app/(tabs)/services/maintenance/common-area/create.tsx`
- `package.json`

### Fixes Applied

#### Package Management
- ✅ Installed `expo-audio` package: `npx expo install expo-audio`
- ✅ Removed deprecated `expo-av` package: `npm uninstall expo-av`

#### Code Updates
**File**: `/app/(tabs)/services/maintenance/common-area/create.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
import { Audio } from 'expo-av';
const [recording, setRecording] = useState<Audio.Recording | null>(null);
const permission = await Audio.requestPermissionsAsync();
```

**After**:
```typescript
import { useAudioRecorder, useAudioPlayer, AudioModule } from 'expo-audio';
const audioRecorder = useAudioRecorder();
const permission = await AudioModule.requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();
```

### Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Successfully migrated from expo-av to expo-audio

---

## 4. Additional Issues Fixed

### Icon Mapping Warning
```
WARN Icon "users" not found in LucideIcons mapping
```
**Status**: ⚠️ **NOTED** - Not directly addressed in this session

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. DisplayName Issues
- Function declarations can have compatibility issues with displayName assignments
- Arrow functions (`const Component = () => {}`) work better with displayName
- React DevTools actively tries to access displayName properties during development

### 2. Debugging Approach
- Multiple similar fixes were attempted before finding the root cause
- The error location (line 47) was misleading - the actual issue was with the function declaration on line 45
- Systematic investigation with specialized agents was more effective than incremental fixes

### 3. Migration Best Practices
- Always check deprecation warnings during major version upgrades
- Test audio/video functionality after migrating from expo-av to expo-audio/expo-video
- Ensure TypeScript types are properly updated after package migrations

---

## Files Modified

### Component Files
- `/app/manager/support/index.tsx` - Changed to arrow function
- `/components/auth/RoleGuard.tsx` - Fixed displayName assignment order
- `/app/(tabs)/services/maintenance/common-area/create.tsx` - Migrated to expo-audio

### Hook Files  
- `/hooks/useDirectAuth.ts` - Added displayName to authSelector
- `/hooks/useDirectSociety.ts` - Added displayName to selector
- `/hooks/useDirectAdmin.ts` - Added displayName to selector

### Package Files
- `package.json` - Replaced expo-av with expo-audio

---

## Status Summary

✅ **RESOLVED**: Missing default exports  
✅ **RESOLVED**: DisplayName property errors  
✅ **RESOLVED**: Expo-AV deprecation warnings  
⚠️ **NOTED**: Icon mapping warnings (not critical)

---

## Future Prevention

1. **Use arrow functions** for React components that need displayName
2. **Always assign displayName** to selector functions used with Zustand
3. **Check for deprecation warnings** during dependency updates  
4. **Test component navigation** thoroughly after making structural changes
5. **Use specialized debugging agents** for complex React Native issues
