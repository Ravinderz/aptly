# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Maestro for end-to-end (E2E) testing in the Expo managed Aptly application. Maestro is a mobile UI testing framework that provides simple, reliable, and fast testing capabilities for Expo apps. The implementation will follow best practices including proper testId attribution, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to create maintainable and effective E2E tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up Maestro testing framework, so that I can write and execute reliable E2E tests for the mobile application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Maestro is installed and configured THEN the system SHALL provide a working E2E testing environment for Expo managed apps
2. WHEN Maestro configuration is created THEN the system SHALL include proper setup for Expo Router and Expo managed workflow
3. WHEN test scripts are added to package.json THEN developers SHALL be able to run E2E tests with simple commands using Expo development builds
4. WHEN Maestro is integrated with the project THEN it SHALL work with Expo development builds on both iOS and Android simulators/devices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add testId attributes to all screens and components, so that Maestro tests can reliably identify and interact with UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testId attributes are added to screens THEN each screen SHALL have a unique, descriptive testId
2. WHEN testId attributes are added to interactive elements THEN buttons, inputs, and navigation elements SHALL have consistent testId naming conventions
3. WHEN testId naming conventions are established THEN they SHALL follow a hierarchical pattern (screen.component.element)
4. WHEN testId attributes are implemented THEN they SHALL not affect the visual appearance or functionality of the app

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create E2E test flows for critical user journeys, so that I can ensure the application works correctly from a user perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication flow tests are created THEN they SHALL cover phone registration, OTP verification, and profile setup
2. WHEN navigation tests are created THEN they SHALL verify tab navigation and screen transitions work correctly
3. WHEN admin functionality tests are created THEN they SHALL cover admin login, dashboard access, and key admin features
4. WHEN community features tests are created THEN they SHALL verify posting, commenting, and social interactions
5. WHEN visitor management tests are created THEN they SHALL cover visitor registration, approval, and QR code generation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement reusable test utilities and helpers, so that I can write maintainable tests following DRY principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test utilities are created THEN they SHALL provide common actions like login, navigation, and form filling
2. WHEN test helpers are implemented THEN they SHALL include wait conditions, element finders, and assertion helpers
3. WHEN test data management is implemented THEN it SHALL provide consistent test data across different test scenarios
4. WHEN test utilities follow DRY principles THEN common test patterns SHALL be abstracted into reusable functions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize test files with clear structure and naming conventions, so that tests are easy to maintain and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files are organized THEN they SHALL follow a logical directory structure separating different test types
2. WHEN test naming conventions are established THEN test files SHALL have descriptive names indicating their purpose
3. WHEN test documentation is created THEN it SHALL include setup instructions, running tests, and troubleshooting guides
4. WHEN test configuration is implemented THEN it SHALL support different environments (development, staging, production)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement CI/CD integration for Maestro tests, so that E2E tests run automatically in the development pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI/CD configuration is created THEN Maestro tests SHALL run automatically on pull requests
2. WHEN test reporting is implemented THEN test results SHALL be clearly visible in CI/CD pipeline
3. WHEN test failure handling is configured THEN failed tests SHALL prevent deployment and provide clear error messages
4. WHEN test performance is optimized THEN E2E tests SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
