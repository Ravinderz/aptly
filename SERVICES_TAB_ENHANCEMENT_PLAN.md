## **🤔 Questions for Discussion:**

### **Technical Implementation:**
1. **File Upload Strategy:** Should we use Supabase Storage or integrate with cloud storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud)?

2. **Payment Integration:** Which payment gateway would you prefer?
   - Razorpay (popular in India)
   - PayU 
   - Stripe (international)
   - Multiple gateway support?

3. **Real-time Updates:** Should we implement:
   - WebSocket connections for live status updates?
   - Push notifications for status changes?
   - WhatsApp Business API integration?

### **User Experience:**
1. **Voice Features:** How important is Hindi/regional language voice note support for your target users?

2. **Offline Capability:** Should maintenance requests work offline and sync when connected?

3. **Emergency Escalation:** What should trigger automatic escalation (timeline-based or manual)?

### **Business Logic:**
1. **Vendor Management:** Should residents be able to:
   - Rate and review service providers?
   - Request specific vendors for their work?
   - Get multiple quotes for expensive repairs?

2. **Approval Workflows:** For maintenance requests:
   - Should all requests go through committee approval?
   - Different approval rules for common vs individual flat issues?
   - Automatic approval for emergency requests?

3. **Cost Management:** 
   - Should residents see real-time cost estimates?
   - Approval required above certain amount thresholds?
   - Budget tracking for the society?

### **Priority Questions:**
1. **Which phase should we start with first?** (Recommended: Phase 1 - Create Maintenance Request)

2. **Are there any specific Indian regulations/compliance requirements** for digital payments or record-keeping we should consider?

3. **Target timeline** for each phase?
