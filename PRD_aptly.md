# Housing Society Management App PRD: India Edition

## Executive Summary

This Product Requirements Document outlines the development of a comprehensive housing society management application specifically designed for Indian residential communities under 100 units. Built on Expo React Native with a robust tech stack including Supabase, Firebase, and NativeWindCSS, the app addresses critical gaps in the Indian housing society management market.

**The core value proposition centers on Indian housing society requirements including GST compliance, maintenance billing, committee management, and culturally appropriate features** while maintaining cost-effectiveness for smaller societies. Research indicates that 64% of property managers in India budget ₹3,000-₹8,000 monthly for software solutions, creating a clear target for pricing strategy.

**Key differentiators include GST-compliant billing, committee voting features, vendor management with local service providers, and pricing structure that accommodates Indian housing society budgets.** The solution addresses the underserved market where existing solutions like ApnaComplex and Society Notebook are either too expensive or lack modern mobile-first design.

## Product Vision Statement

To create the most intuitive, affordable, and culturally-relevant housing society management platform that transforms how Indian residential communities operate, connect, and thrive. We envision a future where society management technology enhances community relationships while ensuring GST compliance and transparency, making professional-grade tools accessible to societies of all sizes across India.
