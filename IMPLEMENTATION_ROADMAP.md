  - last message from our session. read this and continue from here, Now let me work on Phase 5.2 - adding utility methods and code quality
  improvements. Let me create some useful utility functions:

⏺ Write(utils/formatting.ts)
  ⎿  Wrote 217 lines to utils/formatting.ts
     /**
      *Formatting utility functions for the Aptly app
      * These functions provide consistent formatting across the application
      */
     /**
      * Format currency values in Indian Rupee format
      *@param amount - The amount to format
      * @param options - Optional formatting options
      * @returns Formatted currency string

     … +207 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me create a utility for common UI helpers:

⏺ Write(utils/ui.ts)
  ⎿  Wrote 245 lines to utils/ui.ts
     /**
      *UI utility functions for the Aptly app
      * These functions provide common UI-related functionality
      */
     import { Dimensions, Platform, StatusBar } from 'react-native';
     /**
      * Get device dimensions with safe area considerations
      */
     … +235 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me create a utility for form validation improvements:

⏺ Read(utils/validation.ts)
  ⎿  Read 232 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
  ⎿  Claude usage limit reached. Your limit will reset at 4:30am
     (Asia/Calcutta).

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach

1. **Local Storage Structure**: Use AsyncStorage with proper data models
2. **Mock API Layer**: Extend existing APIService with mock responses
3. **Component Reusability**: Leverage existing UI components
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build features incrementally

### File Structure Additions

```
utils/
├── validation.ts          # Form validation utilities
├── storage.ts            # AsyncStorage helpers
├── commission.ts         # Billing commission logic
└── testing.ts           # Test utilities

types/
├── billing.ts           # Billing system types
├── settings.ts          # Settings related types
└── storage.ts           # Local storage types

components/ui/
├── BillerCard.tsx       # Utility biller components
├── DocumentViewer.tsx   # Document management
└── VehicleForm.tsx      # Vehicle management forms
```

### Success Metrics

- All 26 issues resolved
- Zero critical bugs
- 90%+ test coverage
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Lint-free codebase
- Revenue-ready billing system

### Dependencies & Risks

- **Risk**: Complex billing integration may require external APIs
- **Mitigation**: Start with mock implementation, upgrade later
- **Risk**: Local storage limitations for document management  
- **Mitigation**: Implement file size limits and compression

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 implementation
2. Set up testing infrastructure early
3. Create mock data structures for local storage
4. Regular progress reviews after each phase
5. User testing for billing system before launch

This roadmap ensures systematic resolution of all issues while building toward a revenue-generating platform.
