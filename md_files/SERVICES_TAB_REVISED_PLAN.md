## **🔧 Key Implementation Focus:**

1. **Start with Vendor Directory** - Most immediate resident value
2. **Common Area Maintenance** - Society management efficiency 
3. **Payment Integration** - Revenue and resident convenience

**No individual apartment maintenance** - Residents coordinate directly with vendors from the directory, society only manages common area issues through the app.

This focused approach delivers maximum value while keeping scope manageable and aligned with your requirements.
