# Aptly Mobile App: Codebase Analysis and Recommendations

## 1. Overall Architecture

The project is a React Native application built with the Expo framework, utilizing a modern and robust stack.

- **Framework:** React Native with Expo
- **Navigation:** `expo-router` for file-based routing.
- **Styling:** Nativewind (`tailwindcss` for React Native) for UI components.
- **State Management:** React Context API (`AuthContext`, `FeatureFlagContext`, etc.).
- **API Communication:** `axios` for making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with secure storage for tokens.
- **Testing:** Jest with React Native Testing Library.

The project structure is well-organized, with a clear separation of concerns between UI components, services, contexts, and utility functions. The use of `expo-router` simplifies navigation and deep linking.

## 2. Authentication and Security Analysis

### 2.1. Authentication Flow

The authentication process follows a standard mobile authentication pattern:

1.  **Phone Number Registration:** The user provides their phone number and a society code.
2.  **OTP Verification:** The backend sends an OTP to the user's phone, which they must enter to verify their identity.
3.  **Profile Setup:** New users are guided through a profile creation process.
4.  **Token-Based Access:** Upon successful authentication, the app receives JWT (access and refresh) tokens, which are used for subsequent API requests.
5.  **Biometric Authentication:** The app provides an option for users to enable biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID) for quicker and more secure logins.

### 2.2. Token Management

- **Access Token:** Stored in `expo-secure-store`, which is appropriate for sensitive data. It is sent with each API request to authorize the user.
- **Refresh Token:** Also stored in `expo-secure-store`. It is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires, preventing the user from having to log in again.
- **Token Refresh Mechanism:** The `APIService` includes an interceptor that automatically handles token refresh when a 401 Unauthorized response is received. This is a good practice.

### 2.3. Security Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

- **No Root/Jailbreak Detection:** The app does not appear to check if the device is rooted (Android) or jailbroken (iOS). Malicious actors could exploit a compromised device to tamper with the app's runtime behavior.
  - **Recommendation:** Implement root/jailbreak detection and restrict app functionality or alert the user if the device is compromised.
- **No SSL Pinning:** The app does not seem to implement SSL pinning. This makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept and decrypt traffic between the app and the backend.
  - **Recommendation:** Implement SSL pinning to ensure the app only communicates with the trusted backend server.
- **Sensitive Data in AsyncStorage:** While tokens are stored securely, `AsyncStorage` is used for storing the user profile. `AsyncStorage` is not encrypted, and its data can be accessed on a rooted/jailbroken device.
  - **Recommendation:** Store all sensitive user information in `expo-secure-store` or encrypt it before storing it in `AsyncStorage`.
- **Demo OTP:** The `auth.service.ts` file contains a hardcoded demo OTP (`123456`). This is a significant security risk and must be removed before production.
  - **Recommendation:** Remove the hardcoded OTP and integrate with a real OTP generation and verification service.

## 3. Pending Implementations

Based on the codebase, the following features and functionalities are either missing or incomplete:

- **User Profile Editing:** While there is a profile setup flow, there is no clear implementation for users to edit their profile information after it has been created.
- **Visitor Management:** The UI for visitor management is present, but the underlying logic for creating, updating, and managing visitors is not fully implemented.
- **Community Features:** The community section, including posts, comments, and interactions, is not yet functional.
- **Services:** The "Services" tab is present, but the features within it (e.g., maintenance requests, bill payments) are not implemented.
- **Settings:** The settings screen is not fully implemented. It should include options for managing notifications, privacy, and account settings.
- **Notifications:** While there is a `notifications.tsx` screen, the logic for handling push notifications and in-app notifications is not complete.
- **Error Handling:** While the `APIService` has basic error handling, the UI does not consistently display user-friendly error messages for API failures or network issues.
- **Offline Support:** The `APIService` has a request queue for offline support, but it is not fully integrated with the UI to provide a seamless offline experience.

## 4. Backend API Endpoint Requirements

The `types/api.ts` file provides a comprehensive list of the expected API endpoints. Here is a summary of the key endpoints required for the application to be fully functional:

### 4.1. Authentication

- `POST /auth/register-phone`: Register a new user with a phone number and society code.
- `POST /auth/verify-otp`: Verify the OTP sent to the user's phone.
- `POST /auth/refresh`: Obtain a new access token using a refresh token.
- `POST /auth/logout`: Invalidate the user's session.
- `GET /auth/me`: Get the current user's profile.
- `PUT /auth/profile`: Update the current user's profile.

### 4.2. Society

- `GET /societies/search`: Search for societies by name or code.
- `GET /societies/verify/{code}`: Verify a society code.
- `GET /societies/{id}/residents`: Get a list of residents in a society.

### 4.3. Visitor Management

- `POST /visitors`: Create a new visitor entry.
- `GET /visitors`: Get a list of visitors.
- `GET /visitors/{id}`: Get details of a specific visitor.
- `PUT /visitors/{id}`: Update a visitor's status (approve, reject, check-in, check-out).

### 4.4. Community

- `POST /posts`: Create a new community post.
- `GET /posts`: Get a list of community posts.
- `POST /posts/{id}/comments`: Add a comment to a post.
- `POST /posts/{id}/like`: Like or unlike a post.

### 4.5. Services

- `POST /services/maintenance`: Create a new maintenance request.
- `GET /services/maintenance`: Get a list of maintenance requests.
- `GET /services/billing/bills`: Get a list of bills.
- `POST /services/billing/bills/{id}/pay`: Pay a bill.

### 4.6. Notifications

- `GET /notifications`: Get a list of notifications for the user.
- `POST /notifications/read`: Mark notifications as read.
- `POST /notifications/token`: Register a device token for push notifications.

## 5. Recommendations

- **State Management:** For a more complex application like this, consider using a more robust state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand. This will help manage the application state more efficiently and predictably.
- **Error Handling:** Implement a global error handling strategy to provide consistent and user-friendly feedback for API errors, network issues, and other unexpected problems.
- **Code Quality:** Enforce stricter linting rules and consider adding a code formatter like Prettier to maintain a consistent code style across the project.
- **Testing:** While there is a good foundation for testing, increase the test coverage for critical components and business logic to ensure the app is reliable and bug-free.
- **CI/CD:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. This will improve development velocity and reduce the risk of manual errors.
