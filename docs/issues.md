## üìã Current Issues

‚úÖ **Runtime warnings fixed!**

### Recently Fixed

- ‚úÖ **LucideIcons mapping warnings** for `bookUser`, `wrench`, `briefcaseBusiness`, and `phoneCall`
- ‚úÖ **Expo Router layout warnings** for non-existent routes in services/_layout.tsx
- ‚úÖ **Additional layout warnings** for "create" routes in maintenance/_layout.tsx  
- ‚úÖ **Native driver animation error** caused by mixed useNativeDriver settings in HeaderAction component
- ‚úÖ **Context provider errors** for `useGovernance` and `useAnalytics` hooks in settings tabs

### Current Status

- **Icon system**: ‚úÖ Fully functional with comprehensive mappings
- **Routing system**: ‚úÖ Clean layout configuration without warnings  
- **Design system**: ‚úÖ Compliant throughout the codebase
- **Context providers**: ‚úÖ All required contexts available app-wide
- **Runtime**: ‚úÖ No more console warnings for icons, routes, or context issues

### Technical Fixes Made

#### Layout Issues

- **services/_layout.tsx**: Removed references to non-existent nested routes  
- **maintenance/_layout.tsx**: Fixed "create" route reference to match actual file structure

#### Animation Issues

- **HeaderAction.tsx**: Changed scale animations from `useNativeDriver: true` to `useNativeDriver: false` to match shadow animations and prevent driver conflicts

#### Context Provider Issues

- **REVERTED**: Root-level providers approach as per user preference  
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Option 3 - Direct state management without context dependencies
- **governance-settings.tsx**: Replaced `useGovernance` context with direct AsyncStorage and helper functions
- **analytics-settings.tsx**: Replaced `useAnalytics` context with direct AsyncStorage and helper functions

## üîç **Detailed Root Cause Analysis**

### Context Provider Issue

**üö® Root Cause:**
The settings pages (`analytics-settings.tsx` and `governance-settings.tsx`) were trying to use React context hooks (`useAnalytics` and `useGovernance`) but the corresponding providers (`AnalyticsProvider` and `GovernanceProvider`) were not included in the component tree hierarchy.

**üìã Why This Happened:**

1. **Missing Provider Setup**: The app only had `AuthProvider` at the root level in `app/_layout.tsx`
2. **Component Dependencies**: Settings pages needed access to governance and analytics contexts to:
   - Manage user preferences for notifications, permissions, etc.
   - Display current settings and allow users to modify them
   - Access user role information for permission-based UI
3. **Context Boundary Issue**: React contexts only work when components are wrapped by their corresponding providers

**‚úÖ Solution Applied (Option 3 - Remove Context Dependencies):**

- **governance-settings.tsx**: Replaced context usage with direct state management
  - Added helper functions: `canUserPerformAction`, `updateUserPreferences`, `loadUserPreferences`
  - Uses AsyncStorage directly for persistence with keys: `governance_preferences`, `user_role`, `governance_last_updated`
  - Local component state replaces context state for preferences and user role
- **analytics-settings.tsx**: Applied same pattern as governance settings
  - Added helper functions: `canUserAccessAnalytics`, `canUserExportData`, `canUserManageNotifications`, `updateAnalyticsPreferences`, `loadAnalyticsPreferences`
  - Uses AsyncStorage directly with keys: `analytics_preferences`, `user_role`, `analytics_last_updated`
  - Local component state manages all preferences and user role data

**üéØ Alternative Solutions Considered:**

1. **Local providers in settings**: Would work but create multiple provider instances
2. **Remove context dependency**: Would require rewriting settings logic  
3. **Conditional providers**: More complex, harder to maintain

### Notes

- TypeScript compilation errors exist but are pre-existing issues not related to icon/design system fixes
- All runtime console warnings from the original issues have been resolved
- App should now run without layout, animation, or context warnings
- Animation performance may be slightly reduced but stability is improved
- Context providers add minimal overhead as they only initialize when needed

**Status**: All critical runtime warnings and context errors have been successfully resolved! üéâ
