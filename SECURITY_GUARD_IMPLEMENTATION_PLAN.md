## 📋 Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for integrating a **Security Guard persona** into the existing Aptly React Native application. The Security Guard role will be responsible for complete visitor management operations including check-in/check-out processes, visitor registration, real-time tracking, and maintaining security logs - all while being restricted from admin and resident functionalities.

### Key Objectives
- ✅ Create dedicated Security Guard dashboard and workflows **[COMPLETED]**
- ✅ Implement comprehensive visitor management system **[COMPLETED]**  
- ✅ Ensure role-based access control with strict security boundaries **[COMPLETED]**
- ✅ Integrate seamlessly with existing authentication and navigation systems **[COMPLETED]**
- ✅ Provide mobile-optimized interface for security operations **[COMPLETED]**

### 🎯 **Current Implementation Status**

**✅ PHASES COMPLETED:**
- **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** - Complete authentication, permissions, and role-based access control
- **Phase 2: Security Guard Layout & Navigation** - Full featured security interface with visitor management, emergency response, and vehicle tracking

**🔄 READY FOR NEXT PHASE:**
- **Phase 3: Enhanced Visitor Management** - Advanced features like photo capture, ID verification, and detailed visitor profiles

---

## 🎯 Requirements Analysis

### Security Guard Role Responsibilities

**Primary Functions:**
1. **Visitor Management** (Core responsibility)
   - Create new visitor entries upon arrival if not already in system
   - Grant access by capturing necessary visitor details (ID, photo, purpose)
   - Log out visitors when they leave the premises
   - Track visitor status in real-time (inside, outside, overstay)

2. **Access Control & Security:**
   - NO access to admin screens/functions
   - NO access to resident persona screens  
   - LIMITED access only to visitor management features
   - Restricted dashboard with security-relevant functions only

3. **Core Workflows:**
   - Visitor check-in process with verification
   - Visitor check-out process with time logging
   - Search and manage existing visitors
   - View comprehensive visitor history and logs
   - Handle emergency situations and alerts

### Current System Context

**Existing User Roles:**
- `super_admin` - Full system access
- `community_manager` - Society management  
- `society_admin` - Society-level administration
- `resident` - Resident-specific features
- `guest` - Public/limited access

**Current Visitor System:**
- **Location**: `/app/(tabs)/visitor/` directory
- **Files**: `_layout.tsx`, `addVisitor.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `visitorList.tsx`
- **Current Access**: Resident-level permissions (needs security guard extension)
