# Community Tab - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Current Implementation Analysis

The current communities tab has **excellent UI foundation** with proper design system compliance but lacks functional backend integration. It's essentially a high-fidelity prototype with:

✅ **Strengths:**
- Clean, consistent design following the app's indigo color scheme
- Proper component architecture with reusable UI components
- Well-structured post card layout with user avatars and metadata
- Responsive search and filter interface
- Follows existing design patterns from other tabs

❌ **Missing Functionality:**
- No state management or API integration
- Static post data with Lorem ipsum content
- Non-functional post creation, search, and filtering
- No user interactions (likes, comments, deletion)
- No authentication context integration

  category: CategoryType;
  content: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  likesCount: number;
  commentsCount: number;
  isLikedByUser: boolean;
  canEdit: boolean;
  canDelete: boolean;
}

interface Comment {
  id: string;
